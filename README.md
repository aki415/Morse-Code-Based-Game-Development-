# Morse-Code-Based-Game-Development-
Developed an interactive morse code based game on a Raspberry Pi Pico, using C programming for GPIO and PIO handling. The program used a watchdog timer for game state management, and an RGB LED for visual feedback. The game  had multiple difficulty levels and challenged users to input the correct morse code.
